## Description

My Cookbook.  This is an application that truly comes from a good place.  I love to cook and what better way to reinforce that love than with an app that will consolidate all of my recipes that I have collected over the years.  My MVP is to create an app with full CRUD functionality incorporating React for a frontend and Rails with PostgreSQL for the backend.
