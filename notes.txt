Timeline - 

- Spent 1st part of morning 8 - 9 researching on youtube various recipe apps using both Firebase and Rails with React before thinking I would like to use Rails with PostgreSQL
- 9 - 10:30 :  Going thru how I want to set up the project i.e. CRUD, parent and child components, etc.  Found myself starting in on the project and working on the homepage.
              : Had some issues with my webpacker not being installed and fixed some bugs to get homepage to render.
10:30 -2pm:  Been kind of on a roll putting this together!  found a great resource for styling of recipe pages
2pm -  :  i am now stuck and will need to do some more research on the creation of recipes. I think i may have spent most of my mental energy this morning with a resource i found
4pm - : still watching tutorials and videos i.e. adding recipes, Authorization etc.  i think my brain may be shutting down;)
